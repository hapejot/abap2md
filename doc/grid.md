# ZR_ALV_GRID

alv grid


## DESCRIPTION

this program demonstrates a mininmal application using an alv grid object.
this grid is displayed in a specified custom container in a separate dynpro.
this dynpro with number 0001 contains only this container for displaying the grid.

### Alternatives

alternative solutions suffer the problem that they sometimes overlap some gui parts
like GOS toolbar or things like that. This solution natively fits into the standard
way how the SAP Gui interprets forms.

**P_X**
: sample parameter entered in the selection screen. So the selection screen isn't empty.

Release Notes 7.50.9:

* Bugfix: In some situations the error message "POSIX_CLOCK: ERROR in get_posix_nanoseconds() !!!!! (ret = -1)"
  is printed to the console. This happens when a server receives a call or a client receives an RFC callback,
  and none of the following actions have yet occured:
  - no trace entry has yet been written
  - no entry to the dev_rfc.log has yet been written
  - no Websocket call has yet been made
  - and no throughput object has yet been created.
    
* Bugfix: Websocket server
  When shutting down a Websocket server, open connections are not properly closed, which results in a memory leak.
  
* Bugfix: Tracing
  Setting the RFC_MINIMUM_TRACE_LEVEL does not increase the global trace level, if the current global trace level
  is smaller than the minimum.
  
* Bugfix: tRFC
  If no transaction handler for tRFC is installed, a crash in ~RfcTransaction can occur.
  
* Bugfix: Setter/Getter API
  Calling a setter API on a cloned row structure of a table, after deleting the original table, leads to a crash.

* Bugfix: XRfc
  When receiving an XRfc call (nested structures or tables in IMPORTING/EXPORTING/CHANGING), the XRfcParser can crash,
  if the call contains a parameter/field whose name is 30 characters long, contains one _ (underscore) character in the
  middle and ends with an _ (underscore character), and if this fieldname is split accross two network containers in
  such a way, that the middle underscore character is the last character of the first container.

* Bugfix: RFC Callback
  ABAP dump information is not written to dev_rfc.log in case of an RFC Callback.

* Enhancement: Throughput
  Two new getters for the time for reading and writing to the network were added: RfcGetNetworkWritingTime() and RfcGetNetworkReadingTime().
  
* Enhancement: Websocket server
  The two APIs RfcSetWebsocketPingInterval() and RfcSetWebsocketPongTimeout() allow setting the global 
  Websocket ping idle time interval and pong reply timeout for Websocket servers. Both values can also be set
  via RFC_WEBSOCKET_PING_INTERVAL and RFC_WEBSOCKET_PONG_TIMEOUT in the sapnwrfc.ini.
  
* Enhancement: Tracing
  The trace level 4 was introduced, so that setter and getter APIs can be turned off separately.
  
* Enhancement: t/q/bgRFC
  The convenvience function RfcConfirmTransactionID() has been added to allow confirming a TID
  without the need to store the RFC_TRANSACTION_HANDLE.
  

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Release Notes 7.50.8:

* Bugfix: Metadata API
  Some APIs (RfcGetFunctionDesc(), RfcGetCachedFunctionDesc(), RfcGetTypeDesc(), 
  RfcGetCachedTypeDesc()) returned RFC_OK in the error info structure, although
  the description/handle was not found and is NULL.
  
* Bugfix: Tracing
  Resetting the global trace level to zero via API RfcSetTraceLevel() 
  did not trace finishing the API. 
  
* Bugfix: RFC runtime
  When canceling a CPIC connection, the connection was not deleted leaked memory. 
  
* Bugfix: RFC runtime
  Logging an error caused by not finding the UUID daemon in DllMainInit, lead to a crash
  due to accessing a null FILE pointer.
  
* Bugfix: RFC runtime
  Certain amounts of data received from some SAP systems could cause a crash, due to incomplete
  skipping of data when reading from the network.
  
* Bugfix: RFC runtime
  When using the DEST connection parameter, the parameter USE_REPOSITORY_ROUNDTRIP_OPTIMIZATION was
  overwritten.
  
* Bugfix: Websocket RFC runtime
  Long running Websocket connections could lead to callstack overflow when pings are exchanged.
  
* Bugfix: RFC runtime
  Multithreaded applications could experience refused connections by the backend system. In those cases
  the communication with the message server lead to invalid hostname/IP which were not found.
  
* Bugfix: SNC communication
  The password was sent to backend system when connection parameter SNC_MODE and SNC_SSO were set.
  
* Bugfix: RFC runtime
  Sending large tables (raw data > 2GB) triggered a faulty compression and lead to failures in RfcInvoke()
  or server responses.
  
* Bugfix: RFC Server
  The WebSocket server leaked a pointer when deleting it.
  
* Enhancement: RFC Throughput
  The throughput object now collects the server time received from the backend, i.e.
  time tracked by the backend during the request.
  The value can be fetched with a new API RfcGetServerTime().
  Additionally the SDK now transmitts its server time to the backend, which can be viewed in transaction STAD.
  
* Enhancement: Tracing
  The trace has been improved at various places. The socket trace records more called
  SSL functions.
  


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Release Notes 7.50.7:

* Bugfix: RfcServer runtime
  When using RfcShutdownServer() while at the same time the server is currently
  sending back the response to an RFC call it received, a race condition could
  occur.

* Bugfix: character processing
  On IBM i,  in the EBCDIC variant of NW RFC library, conversion to UTF-8 was not
  working correctly in some places (writing traces, column-based serialization)

* Bugfix: bgRFC server runtime
  If an RfcServer program was acting as a bgRFC server, a potential GetUnitState
  event from the ABAP backend was not  in the EBCDIC variant of NW RFC library 
  processed correctly and the corresponding handler function installed by the
  application was not executed.

* Bugfix: RFC runtime 
  When invoking a remote function module and sending a large amount of data to
  the communication partner Ц i.e. as IMPORT, CHANGING and/or TABLES parameters Ц
  the RFC call sometimes did not succeed and RFC_COMMUNICATION_FAILURE with
  error message text "no SAP ErrInfo available" was reported. At the same time you
  observed a broken CPIC connection at the RFC communication partner side with
  detail error text: "Connection reset by peer". This was caused by a timeout on
  the send operation, for which there shouldn't be any.

* Bugfix: Serialized repository
  If an incomplete repository JSon file was loaded via RfcLoadRepository(), the
  application might have crashed.
  
* Bugfix: Serialized repository
  If a repository JSon file was formatted with tabs and newlines,
  RfcLoadRepository() aborted with an error message like "Expected character '{',
  but read '\n'".

* Bugfix: Serialized repository
  Some repository JSon files created by JCo could not be loaded by the NW RFC
  library. RfcLoadRepository() would abort with the error message "non-unicode
  offset overlaps with the existing elements".

* Bugfix: WebSocket RFC runtime
  A WebSocket RFC connection did not send a proper status code when closing. This
  resulted in a trace entry in the ABAP backend.

* Bugfix: WebSocket RFC Server runtime
  A WebSocket RFC server did not read the entire HTTP upgrade message from the
  ABAP backend and closed the connection, if the message exceeded a certain length.

* Bugfix: WebSocket RFC runtime
  If TLS_TRUST_ALL was enabled, WebSocket RFC client connections did not send the
  client certificate.

* Bugfix: RFC runtime
  When communicating with an older Non-Unicode ABAP system, the connection aborted
  and on ABAP side a shortdump of type CALL_FUNCTION_FORMAT_NOT_SUP was raised.

* Enhancement: RFC with SAP Gui
  Better error handling when launching SAP Gui on Windows

* Enhancement: Server setup for t/q/bgRFC
  The NW RFC library now refuses to accept incoming t/q/bgRFC calls, if the
  application did not install transaction handlers or unit handlers.

* Enhancement: Server authentication handler
  The managed server now provides an (optional) authentication handler, which
  applications can install, if they want to perform some kind of logon routine for
  users connecting to the server.
  See the documentation of the new APIs RfcInstallAuthenticationCheckHandler() and
  five more APIs providing additional details about the user currently trying to
  logon to the server program. A detailed example is provided in the delivery.

* Enhancement: Tracing configuration
  The NW RFC library now allows to customize the trace file size, after which a
  "roll over" to a new file takes place, as well as the number of files that should
  be kept, before the oldest rolled over files get deleted. This can be customized
  via parameters in sapnwrfc.ini and via two new APIs that have been added:
  RfcSetMaximumTraceFileSize() and RfcSetMaximumStoredTraceFiles().

* Enhancement: WebSocket RFC PSE handling
  When establishing a new WebSocket RFC client connection, the PSE is reloaded if
  it was used before and changed afterwards.

* Bugfix: RFC runtime
  If a server program of type "started server" calls RfcListenAndDispatch() with an 
  errorInfo equal to NULL, the program crashes with an Access Violation (Windows) or 
  SIGSEGV (Unix), when the backend side closes the connection. 
  (This affects in particular the kernel program sapkprotp -- see SAP note 2962558.)
  
* Bugfix: RFC runtime
  If a program opens many connections at the same time in multiple parallel threads, 
  the program may occasionally abort due to a failed parameter validation (SIGABRT). 
  (This affects in particular the Internet Graphics Server IGS (igsmux) -- see SAP note 2963158.)


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Release Notes 7.50.6:

* Bugfix: metadata lookup
  When saving a repository which contains function modules with ABAP Exceptions, an
  invalid Json format is created due to a misplaced comma in the Exceptions section.
  
* Bugfix: tracing
  If a global trace level is set and a connection with trace level 0 is created,
  the passed parameters and the end tag of RfcOpenConnection() are not traced.
  
* Bugfix: tracing
  On Linux and MacOS systems two threads can accidentally try to write into the same
  thread trace file, depending on the thread ID.
  
* Bugfix: tracing
  On Windows a wrong line feed is written to the trace file.
  
* Bugfix: tracing
  On Linux the names of exception classes are written to the trace file in a garbled format.
  
* Bugfix: table processing
  Turning off table compression in a client program only works for tables sent into R/3,
  but not for tables received from R/3.
  
* Bugfix: saplogon.ini processing
  If the sapnwrfc.ini file contains a connection parameter longer than 1023 characters,
  it is truncated. This affects in particular the parameter X509CERT=... where the logon
  attempt will fail, if the X.509 certificate is longer than 1014 characters.
  
* Bugfix: monitoring
  For Websocket RFC connections, an attached throughput object accidentally counts the
  time waiting for data on the network and the time spent in the backend in the deserialization
  time. This leads to inaccurate time measurements.
  
* Bugfix: communication
  If the ABAP side closes the connection to a started server program normally, the started
  server program will always receive a final error message:
  RFC_COMMUNICATION_FAILURE "connection closed without message (CM_NO_DATA_RECEIVED)"
  Now RfcListenAnDispatch() will simply return RFC_CLOSED in this case, so C/C++ programs can now
  distinguish, whether the ABAP side is simply finshed with its work and has no more RFC requests,
  or whether a real network error occured.
  
* Bugfix: tracing
  Every time a program loads the SAP NetWeaver RFC SDK library, an entry including the trace
  header is written to the dev_rfc.trc file.


* Enhancement: communication
  Attaching a SAPGui to an RFC connection now works via SAPRouter as well as with Group Logon.

* Enhancement: tracing
  Performance of writing traces was improved.

* Enhancement: connection attributes
  The RFC_ATTRIBUTES members "partnerHost" and "partnerIP" always return the hostname/IP address
  of the backend system as they are known by the backend system itself. If Network Address Translation
  (NAT) is performed between the subnet of the RFC client program and the subnet of the backend system,
  then this hostname/IP address may be unknown or invalid in the subnet of the RFC client program.
  Programs that need the "external" IP address with which a TCP/IP connection to the backend system
  can actually be established from the external network segment, can now obtain it from the new API
  RfcGetPartnerExternalIP().
  If no NAT is used in the current scenario, the value returned by this API will be equal to
  partnerIP/partnerIPv6 from the RFC_ATTRIBUTES.

* Enhancement: Unicode processing
  The two internal headers sapuc.h and sapucx.h have been replaced with the header sapucrfc.h which
  corresponds exactly with the functions exported from libsapucum. Also libsapucum on some platforms
  now exports additional functions, which have so far been missing on these platforms.

* Enhancement: tracing
  The log file dev_rfc.trc is renamed to dev_rfc.log.

* Enhancement: tracing
  Managing trace files in multi-threaded programs has been improved.

* Enhancement: communication
  WebSocket RFC (client and server side) is now supported. This can be used for communicating with
  SAP systems of kernel release 7.77 over the internet (e.g. via a firewall/HTTP proxy) and for
  communicating with other external programs based on the latest versions of NW RFC Lib, JCo or NCo.
  The required connection parameters for WebSocket RFC are documented in the sapnwrfc.ini file.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Release Notes 7.50.5:

* Bugfix: memory leak
  If a registered server ends a call with RFC_NOT_FOUND, the object corresponding to the current
  connection is leaked.

* Bugfix: error handling
  If a registered connection is cancelled by backend (e.g. from SMGW), an incorrect return code
  was returned to the application program. Now the correct RFC_CLOSED is returned.

* Bugfix: table processing
  If the NW RFC Library receives a table of line type RAW from a Unicode backend, and a line of
  the table is not filled completely to the end, then this line is left initial (all zero bytes).

* Bugfix: Unicode processing
  If RfcInvoke() is executed on a connection with ON_CCE=0 (the default setting) against a
  non-Unicode system, and the return data of the called function module contains a parameter of
  type structure whose value contains one or more non-convertible/broken characters, then instead
  of aborting with RFC_CONVERSION_FAILURE (as it should), RfcInvoke() ends with RFC_OK, but in the
  structure all fields following the field with the first broken character are left empty.
  
  
* Enhancement: metadata creation
  If an application creates the metadata of a function module manually using RfcCreateFunctionDesc()
  and then adds exporting parameters to that function description by passing instances of the structure
  RFC_PARAMETER_DESC into RfcAddParameter(), where not all members of that structure are properly
  initialized, then it could happen that during the actual function call the backend did not return a
  value for such an exporting parameter as it was considered to be "inactive". This happened mainly,
  if the member "defaultValue" of the parameter description was uninitialized, so that it contained
  non-zero garbage data.
  Now uninitialized "defaultValue" members in the description of exporting parameters are ignored,
  so that they are active by default and the backend's return values are transmitted to the external
  program. (Nevertheless it is recommened that you properly initialize all inputs that you pass into
  NW RFC API functions! For example an RFC_PARAMETER_DESC structure could be memset to zero, before
  you use it.)
  Note: the undesired behaviour of deactivating exporting parameters, if they had a non-zero "defaultValue",
  is seen only in patch levels 2, 3 and 4. Before that, the problem did not yet occur.
  
* Enhancement: encryption
  New function RfcLoadCryptoLibrary(). This can be used instead of the parameter TLS_SAPCRYPTOLIB,
  if you want to set the path to the SAP Crypto Library programmatically.
  
* Enhancement: RfcServer runtime
  A stateful RFC server now automatically implements SYSTEM_RESET_RFC_SERVER, so that the ABAP side
  can reset the user session on C side.
  
* Enhancement: tracing
  The default encoding for trace files is now UTF-8 instead of the current platform encoding, so that
  traces containing non-ISO characters can now always be written without problems. This behavior can
  still be overridden via parameter RFC_TRACE_ENCODING or function RfcSetTraceEncoding().


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Release Notes 7.50.4:

* Bugfix: logon data
  On Windows: when reading logon information from SAPUILandscape XML files, the
  registry keys LandscapeFileOnServer and CoreLandscapeFileOnServer are now read
  from both registries, the 32bit and the 64bit registries. Otherwise it could happen,
  that the SAPUILandscape XML parser did not find the corresponding XML files.

* Bugfix: logon data
  On Windows: if a SAPUILandscape XML file contains a comment inside the <Messageservers>,
  <Services>, <Routers> or <Includes> section, the SAPUILandscape XML parser aborts with
  an Exception.

* Bugfix: communication
  If the communication partners have different endianity and the sending side sends a
  non-compressed table (< 8kB) and the table definition on the sending side contains less
  (or smaller) fields than the corresponding table definition on the receiving side, then
  the extra fields on the receiving side are filled with garbage data.

* Bugfix: communication
  If the communication partners have different endianity, the library side is a registered
  server program, the RFC destination in SM59 is set to "Non-Unicode" and the server program
  makes an RFC callback, then CHAR data in the backend system's response to that RFC callback
  will be corrupted.

* Bugfix: communication
  If an RFC server program tries to perform an RFC callback on the registered connection at
  a point of time, where a callback is technically not possible (i.e. while not being inside
  the processing of an RFC request that was first received from the backend, so that no backend
  user session is currently attached to the connection), then this could cause the connection
  to be left in an inconsistent state, and the data of the following incoming requests or
  outgoing callbacks could be corrupted.

* Bugfix: error handling
  If an RFC server program uses the "automated server" feature via RfcLaunchServer() and the
  SAP gateway denies the registration (missing entry in the gateway reginfo file for the
  corresponding RFC destination), then the automated server constantly tries to re-register
  in an endless loop.
  With PL 4, the server will now abort the futile registration attempts. As before, the
  application will be informed about this problem via the ErrorListener -- but only once per
  connection instead of millions of times.

* Bugfix: tracing
  If trace is activated via connection parameter, a server program does not trace
  function-related details.

* Enhancement: connection attributes
  The structure RFC_SECURITY_ATTRIBUTES now additionally contains the backend system's SNC ACL key.
  (See members sncAclKey and sncAclKeyLength.)

* Enhancement: table processing
  A new function allows to reserve an empty table with the capacity for a given number of rows:
  RfcReserveCapacity().

* Enhancement: Setter/Getter API
  Added support for new ABAP datatype UTCLONG: fields of this type can now be read and filled
  with the API functions RfcSet/GetString() and RfcSet/GetInt8() and the corresponding "by-index"
  versions.

* Enhancement: tracing
  It is now possible to activate the NI trace (low level network trace) via API function
  RfcSetSocketTraceLevel().

* Enhancement: metadata lookup
  Metadata descriptions of an entire repository can now be saved to file and loaded back in
  from file via the API functions RfcSaveRepository() and RfcLoadRepository(). The format,
  in which the repository is saved, is compatible with the corresponding files created by
  SAP JCo and SAP NCo.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Release Notes 7.50.3:

* Bugfix: metadata lookup
  TurboRepository used wrong parameter length, if Library was Non-Unicode and
  backend was Unicode.

* Bugfix: metadata lookup
  If the TurboRepository was not enabled (e.g. because RFC_METADATA_GET did not
  yet exist in the backend), but RfcMetadataBatchQuery() is used nevertheless,
  then the query result is empty instead of reporting all queries as "failed".

* Bugfix: bgRFC
  If the external RFC program was running on an EBCDIC platform, sending a
  bgRFC unit into a backend system always failed with an error message
  "Unable to convert from code page 'рстр' to code page '4103'" or similar.

* Bugfix: metadata lookup
  If during metadata lookup of a nested type1 structure DDIF_FIELDINFO_GET
  returned an empty LINES_DESC, the process crashed.

* Bugfix: table processing
  RfcAppendRow() did not move the table cursor to the appended table row.

* Bugfix: communication
  RFC connections can hang, if CPIC streaming is used with a communication partner
  that does not yet support streaming.

* Bugfix: Setter/Getter API
  If a table parameter is defined via a DDIC table type that referes to a line type,
  the functions RfcSetStructureFromCharBuffer() and RfcGetStructureIntoCharBuffer() return
  the error message RFC_ILLEGAL_STATE, "Operation possible only for flat structures",
  even though the structure is flat and char-like.

* Bugfix: tracing
  Activating the RFC trace in mulitple threads could lead to a deadlock in certain situations.

* Bugfix: DecFloat datatype
  The previously missing functions for DecFloat processing are now exported from the sapnwrfc lib.

* Bugfix: memory leak
  If the backend system is currently not available, and an RFC server program keeps trying to
  reconnect the registered server connection over a period of time, a large amount of memory is leaked.

* Bugfix: serialization
  If the column-based serialization is used with compression type LAN (parameters SERIALIZATION_FORMAT=
  CB_SERIALIZATION and COMPRESSION_TYPE=LAN) and extremely large table parameters are transferred,
  then the program might sporadically crash.

* Enhancement: Setter/Getter API
  The APIs RfcSet[Structure|Table|AbapObject]() and
  RfcSet[Structure|Table|AbapObject]ByIndex() now check the input handle for NULL.

* Enhancement: connection attributes
  The RFC_ATTRIBUTES structure now contains two new members: partnerIP and partnerIPv6.

* Enhancement: monitoring
  A throughput object has been introduced, with which it is possible to monitor
  the performance of a connection. Find more details in the documentation.

* Enhancement: Unicode processing
  The library libsapucum now exports a number of additional U-functions.

* Enhancement: tracing
  Tracing has been improved to contain timestamps and more exception details.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Release Notes 7.50.2:

* Bugfix: column-based serialization
  When using the column-based serialization aka fast serialization, an RFC Call
  might not have worked or sent wrong data when
  ** calling against a non-unicode system and using char-like parameters.
  ** using NUMC parameters.
  ** using not up-to-date metadata of functions and parameters.

* Bugfix: saplogon.ini/SAPUILandscape.xml processing
  When using saplogon.ini based or SAPUILandscape.xml based logon parameters and
  the specified file did not exist or a referenced <Include> file did not exist,
  the application aborted with an uncaught exception.

* Bugfix: SAPUILandscape.xml processing
  When using SAPUILandscape.xml, the destinations contained in SAPUILandscape
  XML are not found, because the SAPUILandscape XML parser returns an empty list,
  if the XML file does not contain an XML preamble and contains comments. The
  SAPUILandscape parser accidentally interpretes the comments section as SAP system
  information.
  Note: this is actually invalid XML format, but early versions of SAPGui 7.40 used
  to generate such XML files.
  With 7.50.2, the SAPUILandscape parser can now handle these badly formed files
  successfully, as long as the <Landscape> section is at the top of the document.

* Bugfix: RfcServer runtime
  A race condition in RfcShutdownServer() might have lead to a crash, if the server
  was at the same time trying to restore a closed connection.

* Bugfix: tracing
  If a multi-threaded program uses the API function RfcSetTraceDir() in different
  threads at the same time, it may abort with segementation fault/access violation.
  The call stack in the core dump contains the function RfcSetTraceDir().

* Bugfix: Setter/Getter API
  On Windows machines with certain non-English locales the functions RfcSetString()
  or RfcSetFloat() applied to parameters of ABAP type FLOAT or DEC/BCD may crash.
  In the call stack, the function _wsetlocale() can be seen.

* Bugfix: samples
  The trace flag ("-t") in the sample program startrfc has no effect. Starting with
  this patch level, you can now use it in the form "-t x", where x is in the 
  range 1 - 3.

* Bugfix: samples
  If the program rfcexec is used in an ALE scenario and the exported function module
  RFC_REMOTE_EXEC is called with parameter READ not set to 'X', then the executed
  command/program may fail with the following error, if it tries to write to
  stdout:
  ** On Windows: "The process tried to write to a nonexistent pipe" (or sometimes
     "write error")
  ** On Unix/Linux: "write error: broken pipe"

* Bugfix: parameter processing
  If an IMPORTING or CHANGING parameter of a function module has a default value
  defined, and an RFC client application calls this function module without setting
  a value for this parameter, then this default value accidentally gets overwritten
  by an initial value. 
  Consequently the ABAP code, when being executed, is using the initial value
  (e.g. spaces or zeros) instead of the expected default value.

* Bugfix: compiling & linking
  On Windows, when linking a program against the sapnwrfc.lib contained in the
  NW RFC SDK, it can happen that the resulting executable is looking for a
  sapnwrfc.dll with a wrong name and consequently fails to start up.

* Bugfix: runtime
  An RFC request that receives TABLE parameters may abort with
  RFC_MEMORY_INSUFFICIENT, even if the table data is relatively small.

* Enhancement: column-based serialization
  The overall performance of the column-based serialization was improved.

* Enhancement: column-based serialization
  The performance of the column-based serialization was improved dramatically when
  sending the same tables multiple times or sending tables which were previously
  received with the column-based serialization.

* Enhancement: Setter/Getter API
  RfcSetString() is now more tolerant as to what kind of input it accepts: hexadecimal
  digits may now also be given in lowercase.

* Enhancement: platforms
  MacOSX is now available for download as additional platform.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Release Notes 7.50.1:

* Bugfix: missing type definitions
  When compiling RFC programs that use the DecFloat library (header file
  sapdecf.h), the compiler complained about missing type definitions for
  types SAP_LLONG and SAP_ULLONG. The missing definitions have been 
  added.

* Bugfix: RFCServer runtime 
  An RFC server program crashed in the following situation: 
  ** The program receives a function call from ABAP. 
  ** In the function handler, it triggers a callback to ABAP via RfcInvoke(). 
  ** During this callback, the network connection breaks down, e.g. because
     of network problems or because of an abort on ABAP side. 
  This caused the connection object to be deleted inside RfcInvoke(), but
  when processing of the original function call that came in from ABAP
  continued, the RFC library still used the deleted connection object,
  leading to a crash. 

* Bugfix: corrupt sapnwrfc.pdb
  On Microsoft Windows systems, the sapnwrfc.pdb file could not be used to see
  internal symbol information of the sapnwrfc.dll library. 

* Bugfix: crash in SAPUILandscape.xml processing 
  On Microsoft Windows systems, if the SAPGui installation has set the registry
  key HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\SAP\SAPLogon\LandscapeFormatEnabled=1
  and the SAPUILandscape.xml file contains a MessageServer entry where the
  "port" attribute is missing, and the RFC application uses one of the connection
  parameters DEST or SAPLOGON_ID, the RFC library crashed while parsing the
  SAPUILandscape.xml file.
  
* Bugfix: saplogon.ini/SAPUILandscape.xml processing
  On Microsoft Windows systems, if the RFC application used the connection 
  parameter DEST to read further parameters from the sapnwrfc.ini file, and
  SAPGui was installed on the machine, the RFC library also accidentally tried
  to open the saplogon.ini file or the SAPUILandscape.xml file, depending on
  which mechanism is used by SAPGui. 
  (See the above registry key "LandscapeFormatEnabled".)

* Bugfix: tracing
  Fields and parameters of type XSTRING were not traced to the RFC trace file
  correctly.

* Bugfix: tracing
  Scalar parameters, whose byte length is less than 8, were not traced to the
  RFC trace file correctly.

* Bugfix: RfcServer runtime
  It might have happened in certain situations, that an automated server which
  was currently shutting down (RfcShutdownServer() had been called), was still
  trying to register new connections at the gateway.

* Bugfix: RfcServer runtime
  Due to a race condition between the thread that calls RfcShutdownServer() and
  worker threads processing incoming RFC requests, an automated RFC server
  might have crashed during shutdown.

* Bugfix: connection leak
  If the callback function RFC_ON_PASSWORD_CHANGE returned an error code, while
  trying to change an initial or expired password, a stale connection to the
  backend remained open forever. 

* Enhancement: Unicode processing in RfcServer runtime
  An RFC server registered at a non-Unicode destination or against a dynamic
  destination (i.e. a destination not defined in SM59 and used via
  SYSTEM_CONNECT_TO_REG_SERVER) now automatically switches to Unicode upon
  receiving the first request, if the backend system is Unicode. 

* Enhancement: SSO ticket retrieval
  RfcGetPartnerSSOTicket() can now also be used to obtain a ticket from a client
  connection. (Prior to this, it worked only for server connections.)

* Enhancement: session handling for automated RFC server 
  Applicatons using an automated (multi-count) RFC server, can now register a
  handler to receive notifications whenever a stateful user session starts or
  ends. See callback function RFC_SERVER_SESSION_CHANGE_LISTENER and function
  RfcGetSessionEventAsString(). 

* Enhancement: Additional Setter/Getter API
  Two new functions are now available for setting an entire structure/table-row
  from a char buffer or reading its value into a char buffer. See functions
  RfcSetStructureFromCharBuffer() and RfcGetStructureIntoCharBuffer(). For
  processing tables with many small fields and lots of rows, this can mean a
  huge performance gain.

* Enhancement: saplogon.ini/SAPUILandscape.xml processing
  Applications using saplogon.ini or SAPUILandscape.xml can now read the set of
  logon parameters for a given LOGON_ID. See new functions RfcGetSaplogonEntry()
  and RfcFreeSaplogonEntry().

* Enhancement: SAProuter usage
  A new function is available to return the SAProuter string over which the
  connection has been established, if any. See function RfcGetSapRouter().

* Enhancement: client connection management
  RFC client programs can now avoid problems with firewall/router timeouts
  during long running RFC requests by activating periodic pings on CPIC level.
  See function RfcSetCpicKeepalive(). 

* Enhancement: tracing
  The RFC trace now traces more specific details in case of codepage conversion
  errors. 

* Enhancement: platforms
  The following additional platforms are now available for download:
  ** Linux on PowerPC big-endian architecture
  ** Linux on IBM zSeries

Release notes 7.50

Compared to SAP NetWeaver RFC SDK 7.20, release 7.50 is built on top of newer compilers,
C runtimes, and operating systems. The API remained backward compatible with earlier
releases. so existing programs should continue to work unchanged, when running them with
the new library. Nevertheless, it makes sense to recompile existing programs against the 
new library in order to update also the application program's compiler and C runtime versions.



With NetWeaver RFC SDK 7.50 you get the following new features:
---------------------------------------------------------------

* Support for the fast serialization format, technically a column-based serialization of 
  the data, which has been shipped initially with application server ABAP 7.51.

* When function module invocations last longer than desired, RFC client programs do now
  have the possibility to cancel the execution of the function mdoule on ABAP server
  side.

* Support for ABAP INT8 datatype.

* On Windows systems: support of saplogon.ini and SAPUILandscape.xml. This allows to establish
  connections easily by using the connection parameters already defined in your SAPGui
  installation.

* A new way of programming a registered server has been introduced that is similar to the 
  approach used by JCo and NCo. 
  ** Server takes care of connection management & automatic restart of broken registrations.
     -- No more involved dispatch-loop!
  ** Server can now be used for stateful progamming (server can keep session state across
     multiple function calls).
  ** Group registration at a system for easy support of "Rolling Kernel Switch": instead
     of registering only at one specific gateway, a server program can register at all 
     gateways belonging to one logon group. If one application server is shutdown/restarted,
     the external program can still be reached via the remaining gateways.

* Configurable authorization checks for servers based on the communication partner's
  SysID and SNC name.
